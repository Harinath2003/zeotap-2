Weather Monitoring Application
This is a real-time weather monitoring system that retrieves weather data for various Indian cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad) from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes it, and triggers alerts when defined thresholds are exceeded. Additionally, it provides daily summaries such as average, maximum, and minimum temperatures and dominant weather conditions.

Features
Real-time weather data monitoring for multiple cities.
Temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Configurable alert thresholds for weather conditions (e.g., high temperature).
Daily weather summary calculations (average, max, min temperatures, dominant weather condition).
Extendable design for future features such as frontend visualizations or integration with databases.
Error handling and retries for failed API requests.
Design Choices
Polling Interval: The weather data is fetched at configurable intervals using the polling_interval argument. This allows the system to control the frequency of weather data retrieval.

Temperature Conversion: The temperature is converted from Kelvin (provided by the API) to either Celsius or Fahrenheit based on the temp_unit parameter, providing flexibility for global use.

Alert Thresholds: The system triggers alerts based on user-configured temperature thresholds, providing timely notifications for extreme weather conditions.

Daily Summary: A daily weather summary is calculated based on the day's weather data, including average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the most frequent weather condition.

API and HTTPS: The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. All requests are made over HTTPS for security.

System Architecture
Backend (Python):
The core logic is implemented in Python.
API data is retrieved from OpenWeatherMap.
Error handling is implemented to manage failures in API calls and provide resilience.
Dockerized Setup:
The entire application can be containerized using Docker for ease of deployment.
A containerized web server can be added for real-time data visualization or integration with other services (optional).
Database (Optional):
While this version doesn't include a database, a future version could integrate MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for persistent storage of weather summaries.
Prerequisites
Dependencies
Python 3.8+: Make sure Python is installed on your machine.

To check Python version:

bash
Copy code
python --version
Requests Library: Used for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. Install it using:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests
Docker (Optional for containerization): You can install Docker for running this application in a containerized environment. Follow the installation steps here.

OpenWeatherMap API Key: Sign up for a free API key at OpenWeatherMap.

Add the API key to the .env file (discussed later).

Setup and Running Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/weather-monitoring-app.git
cd weather-monitoring-app
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Python Dependencies: Make sure all required Python libraries are installed. Use the requirements.txt file to install all dependencies.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create .env file: Create a .env file to securely store your API key. The file should contain the following:

makefile
Copy code
API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here
Step 3: Run the Application Locally
bash
Copy code
python weather_monitor.py
You should see the weather data being printed to the console in real-time for each city. The program will also trigger alerts if the temperature exceeds the threshold and will calculate a daily weather summary at midnight.

Step 4: Docker Setup (Optional)
To run the application inside a Docker container, follow these steps:

Create a Dockerfile:

dockerfile
Copy code
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy all files to the working directory
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
ENV API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here

# Expose any necessary ports (optional, if a webserver is added later)
EXPOSE 5000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "weather_monitor.py"]
Build the Docker Image:

Run the following command to build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t weather-monitor .
Run the Docker Container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d --name weather-monitor weather-monitor
This will run the application inside the Docker container.

Step 5: Optional Enhancements
Database Integration: You can extend the application to store weather data in a MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB database. Docker can be used to spin up a database container and integrate it with the application.

Frontend Visualizations: Implement a React.js or Flask-based frontend to visualize real-time weather data and alerts. Use an API to expose weather data to the frontend.

Future Enhancements
Persistent Storage: Add MySQL or MongoDB for storing daily summaries, alerts, and weather data for future reference.

Web Interface: Develop a web interface using Flask/React for displaying weather data, alerts, and daily summaries in real time.

Advanced Alerts: Implement additional alerts based on other weather parameters such as wind speed or humidity.

Performance Optimizations: Introduce multi-threading or asynchronous requests to handle multiple cities more efficiently.
